# NYCTechTimeline

The NYC Tech Timeline is a visualization of the milestones in the history of the NYC tech community. 

Much of the content on this timeline (especially prior to 2008), is drawn from Fred Wilson's amazong Web 2.0 talk -- thanks to him and team for gather all that content. Our objective going forward is to use a crowdsourced approach to track all the key milestones of the history of our community.


While this timeline is something of a walk down memory lane for many, our aim is to really help the community look forward. For instance, as the timeline shows, there's not much silicon in our history -- so hopefully we can think about what we call our community.

As Fred says in the talk, "We have to understand how we got here, to understand where we're going" ... hopefully the best is yet to come.
